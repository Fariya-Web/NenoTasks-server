## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for managing and storing structured and unstructured data efficiently.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing schema-based solutions for application data.

## Backend Features

- **Role-Based Authentication**: Admin, Worker, and User roles with distinct access levels and privileges.
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure and efficient user session management with JSON Web Tokens.
- **RESTful API Design**: Well-structured and scalable endpoints for various features, including user management, tasks, and withdrawals.
- **Withdrawal Management**: API endpoints to handle worker withdrawal requests, approval, and status updates.
- **Data Validation and Sanitization**: Ensures clean and consistent data with middleware like `express-validator`.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized and consistent error handling for all API endpoints.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Uses `morgan` for HTTP request logging and custom logs for debugging.
- **Secure Database Operations**: Proper indexing, querying, and use of MongoDB's aggregation framework for optimized performance.
- **Middleware for Authorization**: Protects endpoints with middleware to verify roles and permissions.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables securely.

## NPM Packages Used

- **`bcryptjs`**: For hashing and securely storing user passwords.
- **`jsonwebtoken`**: To create, sign, and verify JWT tokens for authentication.
- **`cors`**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure API communication.
- **`dotenv`**: Manages environment variables to secure sensitive data like API keys and database URLs.
- **`express-validator`**: Provides middleware for request validation and data sanitization.
- **`morgan`**: Logs HTTP requests for debugging and monitoring API usage.
- **`mongoose`**: Connects the application to MongoDB and defines schemas for data modeling.
- **`stripe`**: Handles backend operations for secure and seamless payment processing.

## Mentionable Features

- **Role-Based Authentication**: APIs are designed to differentiate access based on roles (Admin, Worker, User).
- **JWT Token-Based Security**: Secure all API endpoints with token-based authorization.
- **Withdrawal System**: Comprehensive backend logic for handling withdrawals, updating worker coins, and tracking transaction statuses.
- **Robust Error Handling**: A unified error-handling mechanism to catch and respond to application issues effectively.
- **Secure Payments with Stripe**: Endpoints for Stripe integration to handle transactions.
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing and query optimizations to enhance performance for large datasets.
